              Description
                     Attempt in a safe way to write len bytes from the
                     buffer src to dst in memory. It only works for
                     threads that are in user context, and dst must be a
                     valid user space address.

                     This helper should not be used to implement any
                     kind of security mechanism because of TOC-TOU
                     attacks, but rather to debug, divert, and
                     manipulate execution of semi-cooperative processes.

                     Keep in mind that this feature is meant for
                     experiments, and it has a risk of crashing the
                     system and running programs.  Therefore, when an
                     eBPF program using this helper is attached, a
                     warning including PID and process name is printed
                     to kernel logs.
